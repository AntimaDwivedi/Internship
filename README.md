<b>Project Synopsis:</b><br>
 Automate detection of different emotions refers to the use of language processing and text analysis to identify the different emotions in a comment or feedback.
 I have created a list of different types of human emotions which belongs to a particular word from the dictionary. After cleansing of textual comments, algorithm searches the keyword of textual comments which matches with the emotion list.
 Algorithm counts the appearance of different emotions that how many times in comments a particular emotion is appearing. Output will be  the histogram representation of different emotions.<br>
 <b>Solution Approach:</b> Approach can be grouped into three main categories.<br>
<b>•</b>Tokenization<br>
<b>•</b>Removing stop words<br>
<b>•</b>Keyword Spotting<br>
<b>Tokenization:</b> Different textual comments are broken into tokens.it is convenient approach for detection of emotions.<br>
<b>Removing stop words:</b> Different stop words are removed from the tokenized list so that the words which belongs to a particular emotion remain only.<br>
<b>Keyword Spotting:</b> After the cleansing of data algorithm searches the keyword of textual comments which matches with the emotion list.<br>

<b>Outcome:</b> One can find the occurrence of different emotions in textual comments or feedbacks and easily figure out which is the dominant emotion in the textual comment.<br>
<b>Quickstart:</b><br>
<b>•</b>The application can be run by simply executing main.py
